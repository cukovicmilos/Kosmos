## Usage Examples

### Creating a Reminder

Simply send a message with your reminder text and time:

```
Take fishing rod to the lake tomorrow 16:00
Meeting mon 10:00
Coffee 14:30
```

You'll receive a confirmation showing when the reminder is scheduled:
```
✓ Coffee > 14:30
✓ Meeting > 15.11.2025. 10:00
```

### Quick Access Buttons

After running `/start`, you'll see persistent buttons at the bottom of your chat:
- **📋 List** - Quickly view all your reminders
- **🔁 Recurring** - Create a new recurring reminder

### Postponing Reminders

When a reminder arrives, you can postpone it with:
- Quick actions: 15 min, 30 min, 1h, 3h, 1 day
- Custom time: Choose "Drugo vreme" / "Custom time" and enter specific time (e.g., `19:00` or `tue 14:00`)

After postponing, you'll see:
```
⏰ Coffee > 15:30  (if today)
⏰ Meeting > 16.11.2025. 10:00  (if another day)
```

### Commands

- `/start` - Initialize the bot and show keyboard buttons
- `/list` - View all upcoming reminders
- `/recurring` - Create a recurring reminder (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- `/settings` - Configure language, time format, and timezone
- `/help` - Get help and usage examples

### Creating Recurring Reminders

Use `/recurring` command to create reminders that repeat automatically:

1. **Daily** - Every day at the same time
   ```
   Example: Daily standup meeting at 10:00
   ```

2. **Every X Days** - Repeat every N days
   ```
   Example: Water plants every 3 days at 09:00
   ```

3. **Weekly (Specific Days)** - Repeat on selected weekdays
   ```
   Example: Team meeting every Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 14:00
   ```

4. **Monthly** - Repeat on specific day of the month
   ```
   Example: Pay rent on the 1st of each month at 12:00
   ```

Recurring reminders are shown with a 🔁 icon in your list.

**Postponing Recurring Reminders:**
When you postpone a recurring reminder, a new one-time reminder is created while the original continues on its schedule.

## Project Structure

See [plan.md](../plan.md) for detailed project documentation and implementation plan.

## Development Status

✅ **Completed** - Version 1.1

All major features implemented:
- ✅ Bot initialization with timezone selection
- ✅ Natural language time parsing (SR/EN)
- ✅ Scheduler and reminder delivery with accurate timezone handling
- ✅ **Recurring reminders** (daily, interval, weekly, monthly)
- ✅ Postpone functionality (quick actions + custom time)
- ✅ List and delete reminders (with sequential numbering)
- ✅ Settings configuration (language, time format, timezone)
- ✅ Persistent keyboard buttons for quick access
- ✅ Smart reminder confirmations with scheduled time display

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't start
- Check that `BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly in `.env`
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Reminders not sending
- Check that scheduler is running (you'll see "Reminder scheduler started" in logs)
- Verify database has pending reminders: `sqlite3 kosmos.db "SELECT * FROM reminders WHERE status='pending';"`
- Check logs in `log/app.log` for errors

### Time parsing issues
- Time must be at the end of the message
- If time has passed today (and no day specified), bot assumes tomorrow
- Weekdays always mean next occurrence

### Keyboard buttons not showing
- Send `/start` command to initialize persistent keyboard
- Restart Telegram app if buttons don't appear
- Make sure you have the latest version of Telegram

### Postpone custom time not working
- Make sure to enter time in correct format: `19:00` or `tue 14:00`
- Time must be valid (0-23 hours, 0-59 minutes)
- If entering a day, use supported day names (mon, tue, tomorrow, etc.)

### Database issues
- Delete `kosmos.db` and restart bot to recreate database
- Check file permissions on database file
